            <h4>4. Transactions between the Buyers and Sellers</h4>
            <p>
                4.1 Each User understands and agrees that Onitshamarket.com is not a traditional seller or mart. Through
                the Site, what Onitshamarket.com provides is only an online platform or venue for information exchange
                and transaction between buyers and sellers, including electronic web-based transaction platforms for
                Users to place, accept, conclude, manage and fulfill orders for the provision of products and services
                online subject to the Registration Agreement. Although Onitshamarket.com will monitor the regular
                operation of the Site to fulfill its duty of care, Onitshamarket.com does not review and check each item
                of posted content and listing to search for infringement or illegal activity.
            </p>
            <p>4.2 Despite the Terms, no agency relationship will be created between Onitshamarket.com and any seller or
                buyer concerning the listing and transaction, whether or not such transactions are entered into via the
                Site.
            </p>
            <p> 4.3 User hereby acknowledges that although Onitshamarket.com tries its best to provide Users with
                accurate information and listings posted by sellers, and do general verifications of the identity of
                sellers, there are still risks associated with purchasing from parties online. Therefore, we encourage
                you, the users of the Site, to use relevant tools available, reasonable judgment and common sense when
                making a deal online.
            </p>
            <p> 4.4 In no event shall Onitshamarket.com be responsible for any infringement or transaction dispute,
                including, but not limited to, transaction disputes about quality, safety, breach of warranty,

                intellectual property infringement by sellers.
            </p>
            <p> 4.5 The users (including the seller and buyer) agree to release and indemnify Onitshamarket.com and its
                agents, affiliates, directors, officers and employees from all claims, demands, actions, proceedings,
                costs, expenses and damages (including, but not limited to, any actual, special, incidental or
                consequential damages) arising out of or in connection with any transactional dispute about the
                products, listing, or information on the Site.
            </p>
            <p> 4.6 In order to help the sellers and the Registered Users solve and settle any transactional disputes
                effectively and efficiently, Onitshamarket.com has established the “Handling Procedures for
                Transactional Dispute”. Here, the sellers and Registered Users shall agree that when the Registered
                Users file the transactional disputes with Onitshamarket.com, the sellers and the Registered Users
                should comply with the “Handling Procedures for Transactional Dispute”, and permit Onitshamarket.com to
                make a final binding decision regarding the dispute.
